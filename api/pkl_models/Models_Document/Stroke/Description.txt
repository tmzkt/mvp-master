When building the model, the AutoML library flaml was used.
.pkl file contains description, model and scaler.

Model itself for prediction (presence of stroke); model was buit on data of 5000 people.
its input:
* Age (years) (age of the patient)
* Avg_glucose_level (mg/dL) (avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood)
* BMI: body mass index
* Hypertension (Resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg)


* All gathered features (except 'Hypertension' - it's binary feature) must be transformed by scaler before input

- scaler. Use it as scaler.transform(X)

Scores of the model:
f-1 measure: 0.1492537313432836


How to load a model:
from pickle import load
with open('Stroke.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    description, model, scaler = load(f)


How to make predictions:
sample=[Age, Avg_glucose_level, BMI]
standard_X_without_hypertension = scaler.transform(np.array([[Age, Avg_glucose_level, BMI]]))
standard_X = np.concatenate((standard_X_without_hypertension, Hypertension.values.reshape((number_of_rows,1))), axis=1)
prediction = model.predict(standard_sample)
